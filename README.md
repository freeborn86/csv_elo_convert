Elo Professional Import helper
================================
This Java utility was used for converting from CSV test data to ELO Professional 9 Importable "Dataset"

Description
-----------
* The application needs an existing Export from ELO Professional consisting of at least 2 data records
* The application needs a CSV as defined in csv.ini file (header, delimiter, path)
* If both the above are provided and in the valid format the utility will generate an importable ELO Dataset into the path specified in cnv.ini

Notes
-----
* This code was abandoned as soon as it generated the expected output
* This code is far from clean, or transparent, I'm not proud of it, but there was no motivation to clean it up
